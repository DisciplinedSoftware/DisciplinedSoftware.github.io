#State Pattern 101
Explain the GOF state pattern with an alarm clock example
Explain the issue with the state creation, there seems to be an issue with the new/delete
  I think there is an issue with multi-threading that cannot be fixed easily.
    The issue will happen when the state change, where at one point there is 2 states that exist at the same time
Explain the enum state pattern with an alarm clock
Explain the issue with the enum proposition
Add improvement with an abstract factory
Maybe the enum map is a very good thing to handle the transition and the creation, while the states only handle the state execution
Fix the multi-thread issue by separating the concerne of who does what.
