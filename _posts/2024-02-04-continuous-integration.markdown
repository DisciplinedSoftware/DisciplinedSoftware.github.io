# Context

Customer don't always accept cloud solution.
When in production:
- Computers seldom have Internet access
- Updates are risky and can cost a lot of money even without bugs

No Internet, no continuous deployement

Working on a on-premise solution has more constraints than a cloud solution
- Hard to update customer
- 

I realize that I'm more talking about continuous update.
