# Horizontal Management


Explain the management structure

What I dislike
- Focus on only one aspect of software, it's hard to move a team because its only priority is producing features which now takes a lot of time to produce and are interrupted with a high number of bugs. Teams are stuck in a mindset that it's impossible to go faster and they repeat bad pattern from the past so they keep digging their tomb with even more coupled code. Coupling is so bad that every refactoring seems impossible to achieve.
- The messages need to be align with 13 people, actually 2 of them have their own team so they don't need to align their message to the teams they just need to align they process.
- All teams have to work the same way to make this possible, but on the other hand we don't ask teams to have a common process.
- We need 4 leaders per team which is impossible.
- There is a lot of holes in the process
- Similarly to the Conway's, this amplify that teams need to overcommunicate because there is 5 sources of information per team

Figure out some solution that could be implemented
- Focusing only on one team at a time and start 

Talk about Concorde, where they come up with autonomous teams. Management are very low for this team. They recently split into 3 teams. So let see how they will managed since they are still using the same strategy as before.

# todo
Talk about stagging production since they have 3 products. There's probably no need to validate everything in the other product.
Ask the question about feature design, is there anything planed
